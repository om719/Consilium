	<h3>Name: Mrs Shylaja </h3>
	<h3>Organistaion: PES University</h3>
	<h3>Designation: Chairperson, CSE Dept</h3>
	<h3>Alma Mater: VUT</h3>

<br>
<h3>Can you maybe start off by telling us your qualifications?</h3>
<p>I have a Phd in image processing.</p>
<br>
<!-- <hr>	 -->
<h3>What motivates you to work?</h3>
<p>- I love to interact with students, really get to know their psychology towards teaching. I would've had a psychology degree if not a technical degree. I have an aptitude for research.</p>
<br>
<!-- <hr>	 -->
<h3>Did you do any internships?</h3>
<p>- We didn't have internships at the time.</p>
<br>

<h3>What do you like about this job?</h3>
<p>Inspite of the administration load, I love teaching. I love seeing students happy. There's a lot of self learning involved in this field.</p>
<br>

<h3>What do you think the future of education is?</h3>
<p>The main motive is to shape students. It is important to find something tranformative in this field. The task is to change the field of education and how it's percieved in India, mainly because the students don't feel challenged enough.</p>
<br>

<h3>What do you think is most required in your field?</h3>
<p>The most important thing is being technically sound, and having a constant source of learning.</p>
<br>

<h3>How do you think the field of education has evolved?</h3>
<p>Before the internet, the students were really not well informed. So majority of the load was on me as a teacher to give accurate information. Nowadays, students can research on their own and the dependency has also decreased.</p>
<br>

<h3>What do you think needs to transform?</h3>
<p>There is a lack of good teachers and students as well. Both the reasons maybe linked to the kind of money this field provides. The teachers should be rewarded properly. The inflow of philanthropic work is also required. The challenge is attracting good students to the college. Dealing with heterogeneous group of students is also a challenge, because the exposure every student recieves is varied.</p>
<br>

<h3>What was the most important thing in your journey to getting where you are?</h3>
<p>I don't remember having an exact career path to becoming the HOD, but I can say that having an inbuilt drive for studying and constantly learning is very important along with a technical aptitude.</p>
