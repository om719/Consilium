# WebTech_Project
- Creating a website for interviews of experts. These pertain to experts in various fields ranging from technology to social causes to entertainment. An interactive website that offers a look into the lives and inspirations of these people that other users can learn from and imbibe in their own lives. Could be very useful for aspiring students who are seeking guidance in various fields.Extra features include 
discussion panels about topics and with the experts themselves (as when they can afford to come online and reply).

The Web Pages -
1.	Our home page consists of a search bar where you can manually search for an interviewee or a field.
2.	The topics page shows the various fields that our interviewees belong to.
3.	On clicking on any one of the fields the user is taken to the list of interviews in that field.
4.	On clicking a particular professional you are taken to the interview page itself.
5.	We have a page for message boards for each field on our website.
6.	A discussion forum where users can ask questions to any professional is also included. 
7.	A login and a sign up page for authenticating users.
8.	A plethora of internship opportunities where interested users can apply. 
9.	Verified online courses suggested by our professionals for our enthusiastic users.
